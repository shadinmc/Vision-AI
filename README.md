AI Integrated Smart Glasses for Visually Impaired People
Motivated by the need to assist blind individuals in performing daily tasks independently, this hardware project combines various assistive technologies into a single, unified solution. The concept integrates person recognition, object identification, currency detection, and document reading, all controlled through a voice assistant. The implementation relies on machine learning algorithms for object and face recognition, alongside audio feedback for real-time interaction. The results show enhanced user autonomy, enabling seamless navigation through everyday tasks. This solution provides a cost-effective and accessible device with numerous advantages, such as real-time performance and multi-functional capabilities. However, challenges like accuracy in complex or dynamic environments need further refinement. Overall, the project presents a significant step forward in assistive technologies, making life easier for visually impaired individuals by promoting independence and improving their quality of life.
